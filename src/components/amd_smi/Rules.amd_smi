# Set default if the root environment variable is not already set.
# Note PAPI_AMDSMI_ROOT is an environment variable that must be set.
# There are four other environment variables that must be exported
# for runtime operation; see the README file.

PAPI_AMDSMI_ROOT ?= /opt/rocm

# There is one library used by the AMD_SMI component: libamd_smi64.so
# By default, the software tries to find this in system paths, including
# those listed in the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. If not found
# there it looks in $(PAPI_AMDSMI_ROOT)/lib/libamd_smi64.so

# However, this can be overridden by exporting PAPI_AMD_SMI_LIB as 
# something else. It would still need to be a full path and library name.
# If it is exported, it must work or the component will be disabled. e.g.
# export PAPI_AMD_SMI_LIB=$(PAPI_AMD_SMI_LIB)/lib/libamd_smi64.so
# This allows users to overcome non-standard ROCM installs or specify
# specific version of the libamd_smi64.so library.

# PAPI_AMDSMI_ROOT is used at both at compile time and run time.

# There are many ways to cause this path to be known. Spack is a package
# manager used on supercomputers, Linux and MacOS. If Spack is aware of ROCM,
# it encodes the paths to the necessary libraries.

# The environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH encodes a list of paths to
# search for libraries; separated by a colon (:). New paths can be
# added to LD_LIBRARY_PATH. 
#
# Warning: LD_LIBRARY_PATH often contains directories that apply to other
# installed packages you may be using. Always add to LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# recursively; for example:
 
# >export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=someNewLibraryDirectory:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH which would
# append the existing LD_LIBRARY_PATH to the new directory you wish to add.
# Alternatively, you can prepend it: 
# >export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:someNewLibraryDirectory Which will
# search the existing libraries first, then your new directory.

# You can check on the value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH with 
# >echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH

# There may be other package managers or utilities, for example on a system
# with modules; the command 'module load rocm' may modify LD_LIBRARY_PATH.

# A Linux system will also search for libraries by default in the directories
# listed by /etc/ld.so.conf, and /usr/lib64, /lib64, /usr/lib, /lib. 

# Note:  If you change the exports, PAPI should be rebuilt from scratch; see
# note below.

# Note: AMD_SMI is typically provided with the ROCM libraries, but in PAPI
# ROCM and AMD_SMI are treated as separate components, and must be given
# separately on the configure option --with-components. e.g.

#        From within the papi/src/ director:
#        make clobber
#        ./configure --with-components="amd_smi"
#        make  

# An alternative, for both rocm and amd_smi components:
#        ./configure --with-components="rocm amd_smi"

# OPERATION, per library:
# 1) If an override is not empty, we will use it explicitly and fail if it
# does not work. This means disabling the component; a reason for disabling
# is shown using the papi utility, papi/src/utils/papi_component_avail

# 2) We will attempt to open the library using the normal system library search
# paths; if Spack is present and configured correctly it should deliver the
# proper library. A failure here will be silent; we will proceed to (3).
 
# 3) If that fails, we will try to find the library in the standard installed
# locations listed above. If this fails, we disable the component, the reason
# for disabling is shown using the papi utility,
# papi/src/utils/papi_component_avail.
